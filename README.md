# Boiler

Boiler is an application that automatically prints basic boiler plate code that you can copy and paste into your project.

:Screenshot Goes Here:

Boiler downloads it's templates from a public website and uses GitHub for contributing to the project. In a future version you'll be able to use your own URL as an additonal template repository.


## Examples

```
$boiler go

$boiler go/http

$boiler go/https
```


## Roadmap


### Adding a Path

You can create your own templates by putting them online then adding a boiler environment variable.

boiler=https://example.com/boiler
