    <h1 class="center breathe">The Easiest Way to Standardize Your Team's Code</h1>

    <p class="center breathe">Empower your developers with a simple CLI that outputs clean, consistent boilerplate from a team-maintained repo — no templates, no mess, just best practices in one command.</p>
    
    <img class="breathe" src="image/boiler.gif">

    <h2 class="breathe">Consistent Code. Less Rework. Fewer Questions.</h2>
    <p>Your team wastes time rewriting the same setup code—or worse, doing it five different ways. Boiler fixes that with a shared, source-controlled repo of copy‑pasteable patterns your team can trust.</p>
    
    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>Developers run a single command like <code>boiler go/http</code> to get clean, ready-to-use boilerplate. Want it in a file? Just redirect the output: <code>boiler go/http &gt;&gt; main.go</code>.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Boiler?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simple by Design</strong> — Single-file output keeps things fast and focused. No project scaffolding, no template engines, no complexity.</li>
      <li><strong>Team-Controlled</strong> — Boiler is just a repo. You own it. Your team (or dev ops) maintains the snippets, so they stay up to date and aligned with your standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Language Agnostic</strong> — Works for Go, Terraform, Bash, whatever. If it’s a text file, it works with Boiler.</li>
      <li><strong>Zero Lock-in</strong> — No dashboard. No cloud. No runtime. Just a tiny binary your team installs once.</li>
      <li><strong>One-Time Purchase</strong> — No subscriptions. No seat limits. Buy once and own that version for life — for your entire organization.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>For the Director</h2>
    <p>Stop wasting cycles on code review nitpicks. Standardize with a tool your team will actually use. Boiler brings consistency without the overhead.</p>

    <p class="center breathe">Boiler is just $399 — a one-time payment for your entire team.</p>
